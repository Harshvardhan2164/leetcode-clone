## This is a leetcode clone, looks nothing like it, mainly focused on backend
Code submission is in development

If you want to contribute to the frontend kindly follow the rules as follows:
1. For CSS, id or class of a tag should be named as {pagename-actualid}, For example <button id="Home-loginbutton">.
2. All CSS should be written under the index.css file present in ./client/src/index.css.
